# 📝 Notes Manager App (Java File I/O)

## 🧩 Project Overview
The **Notes Manager App** is a console-based Java application that allows users to **create**, **view**, and **save notes** using **File I/O**.  
It demonstrates how to **read from and write to files** in Java, handle exceptions, and persist data.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **File I/O** – Using `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileWriter`  
- **Exception Handling** – `try-catch-finally`, `try-with-resources`  
- **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions** – e.g., `IOException` (checked)  
- **Persistence** – Saving notes to a file permanently  

---

## 🏗️ Functionality
- Add a new note to a file (append or overwrite mode)  
- View all saved notes  
- Automatically creates `notes.txt` if it does not exist  
- Handles exceptions gracefully with meaningful messages  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** VS Code  
- **Execution:** Terminal  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
